Terralith takes Minecraft's 1.18 massive world generation overhaul, and turns it up to eleven.

## Notes
- Terralith is *technically* compatible with William Wyther's Overhauled Overworld, Biomes O' Plenty, and Oh The Biomes You'll Go; but it requires Terrablender, which screws with the biome distribution
- Terralith is compatible with Tectonic, if you use [Apollo](https://github.com/ApolloDatapacks)'s [Terratonic](https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/terratonic/)
- Do not add this to an existing world - reset yours first, or use a new world
- View the structures and biomes per seed using [jacobsjo](https://github.com/jacobsjo)'s [Minecraft Datapack Map](https://map.jacobsjo.eu/)

## Description
### Biomes
Terralith adds over 95 brand new biomes, as well as updating almost every vanilla biome with new and improved features. There are also new terrain types: canyons, shattered biomes, floating islands, deep ocean trenches, and much, much more.

**Yellowstone** is one of Terralith's staple biomes - a simple and beautiful landscape, based on the real life US National Park. Among the list of realistic biomes are **Yosemite Cliffs**, **Shield**, and many more depending on what you're looking for in a biome. **Highlands** and its variants offer a flat surface to create on - builders can imagine anything from huge mega cities to small simple cottages. Adventurers can explore the breath-taking **Volcanic Peaks** and discover the beautiful **Desert Oases**.

While realistic biomes can remind us of the beautiful planet we live on, Terralith offers a plunge into the world of fantasy as well. Adventurers can wander through the purple and mystical **Moonlight Grove** and **Amethyst Rainforest**, or climb the unforgiving cliffs of the **Scarlet Mountains**. If determined, sailers can find the mysterious **Mirage Isles**, or even the elusive and nostalgic **Alpha Islands**. Terralith encourages imagination to run wild here.

If you feel the surface is too face, have no fear - custom caves lurk beneath your feet! Similar to Minecraft's Lush Cave, the **Underground Jungle** is full of foliage, and rarely some old abandoned houses. Other caves, like **Infested** and **Fungal Caves** are overgrown with spiders and fungi! If you dig super deep, you could stumble upon a sister to the Deep Dark: the **Frostfire Caves** are dangerous and menacing. Beware!

### Structures
To tie all of Terralith's magnificent biomes together are it's structures. The ominous tall **Spire** pierces the sky in the iciest biomes. Rarely, you can find **Fortified Villages** in the plains and desert - the villagers have progressed quite far as a society! Finally, if you find yourself lost at night, cold and hungry, you might stumble into the warm protection of the simple Glacial Hut.
